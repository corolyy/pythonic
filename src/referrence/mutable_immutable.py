"""Parameter passed in
        1. the parameter passed in is actually a reference to an object (but
           the reference is passed by value)
        2. some data types are mutable, but others aren't
    So:
        Â· If you pass a mutable object into a method, the method gets a 
          reference to that same object and you can mutate it to your heart's 
          delight, but if you rebind the reference in the method, the outer 
          scope will know nothing about it, and after you're done, the outer 
          reference will still point at the original object.
        Â· If you pass an immutable object to a method, you still can't rebind 
          the outer reference, and you can't even mutate the object.
    Mutable:  list, dict, set
    Immutable: strings, tuples, numbers
